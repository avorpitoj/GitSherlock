# GitSherlock
GitSherlock is designed to display a personal developer portfolio showcasing our various projects and repositories in a single card. With GitSherlock, it is quicker to locate any specific GitHub user profile and their repositories, code snippets, or files, across a vast array of open-source projects thereby helping us to search and explore code repositories more efficiently.
